# RAG NVIDIA NIM Implementation

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using NVIDIA's NIM framework.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment: 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

- `config/`: Configuration files for model and training
- `data/`: Data storage
  - `raw/`: Raw input data
  - `processed/`: Processed data for training
- `src/`: Source code
  - `data/`: Data processing utilities
  - `model/`: RAG model implementation
  - `training/`: Training scripts and utilities
- `tests/`: Unit tests

## Usage

1. Prepare your data:
```bash
python -m src.data.data_processor --config config/model_config.yaml
```

2. Train the model:
```bash
python -m src.training.trainer --config config/model_config.yaml
```

3. Generate responses:
```python
from src.model.rag_model import RAGModel
model = RAGModel(config)
response = model.generate("Your query here")
```

```

To use this project:

1. Create the directory structure as shown above
2. Copy each file to its respective location
3. Install the required dependencies
4. Customize the configuration in `config/model_config.yaml`
5. Implement the missing components in the model and training scripts based on your specific requirements

Note that this is a basic structure that you'll need to expand based on your specific requirements. The NVIDIA NIM-specific implementations will need to be added according to the framework's documentation and your use case.

Some key points to consider:
- Add proper error handling
- Implement logging throughout the application
- Add type hints and docstrings
- Create unit tests
- Add model checkpointing and resuming capability
- Implement proper validation and evaluation metrics
- Add data validation and cleaning steps
